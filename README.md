#Temperature Calculator

A temperature calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application that allows users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It is typically implemented as a simple web form with three input fields, one for each temperature unit, and a button to perform the conversion.

When the user clicks the button, the JavaScript code in the calculator performs the necessary calculations to convert the input temperature to the other two units. The results are then displayed in the corresponding input fields.

Here is a description of a typical temperature calculator:

The calculator has three input fields, one for each temperature unit: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Each input field is labeled with the corresponding temperature unit.
There is a button labeled "Convert" to perform the conversion.
When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the JavaScript code in the calculator performs the necessary calculations to convert the input temperature to the other two units.
The results are then displayed in the corresponding input fields.
The calculator also includes a validation check to ensure that the user has entered a valid temperature value in at least one of the input fields. If the user has not entered a valid temperature value, the calculator displays an error message.

Here is an example of how to use the temperature calculator:

Enter a temperature value in one of the input fields.
Click the "Convert" button.
The converted temperature values will be displayed in the other two input fields.
For example, if you enter 100 in the Celsius input field, the converted temperature values will be displayed as follows:

Celsius: 100°C
Fahrenheit: 212°F
Kelvin: 373.15K
Temperature calculators can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Converting temperatures for cooking, baking, or other scientific experiments.
Converting temperatures for weather forecasts or travel planning.
Converting temperatures for medical or industrial purposes.
Temperature calculators are a valuable tool for anyone who needs to convert temperatures between different units.
